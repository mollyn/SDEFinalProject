Stochastic Control and forecasting

Those pursuing this area will become proficient in Kalman filters, as initially seen from recursive least
squares and forecasting ideas for Stochastic Processes. Those of you with Bayesian statistics
backgrounds can also view this as Kalman filters from that perspective. This has many broad
application areas, and we cover this material at multiple times throughout the class. Most projects in
this category will be using MATLAB, though the cohort is certainly allowed to use R or Python. A paper
that we will cover in class and that gives some sense for what a ‘near-expert’ should master is the
Young et al 1999 paper (material in Module 8).
